# Daily Coding Problems
These are a set of coding problems sent by email by [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com).

# Organization and content
I'll organize them in folders by problem. Each folder is going to contain a "solution" file which will be in any programming language that fits the best for that problem. An explanation of the solution and also the way of how I solved it will be described in a readme file inside that folder.
